      "When we talk about Data Science and the Data Science Pipeline, we are typically talking about the management of data flows for a specific purpose - the modeling of some hypothesis. The models that we construct can then be used in Data Products as an engine to create more data and actionable results. Machine learning is the art of training some model by using existing data along with a statistical method to create a parametric representation of a model that fits the data. That\u2019s kind of a mouthful, but what that essentially means is that a machine learning algorithm uses statistical processes to learn from examples, then applies what it has learned to future inputs to predict an outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning can classically be summarized with two methodologies: supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, the \u201ccorrect answers\u201d are annotated ahead of time and the algorithm tries to fit a decision space based on those answers. In unsupervised learning, algorithms try to group like examples together, inferring similarities via distance metrics. Machine learning allows us to handle new data in a meaningful way, predicting where new data will fit into our models. \n",
      "\n",
      "Scikit-Learn is a powerful machine learning library implemented in Python with numeric and scientific computing powerhouses Numpy, Scipy, and matplotlib for extremely fast analysis of small to medium sized data sets. It is open source, commercially usable and contains many modern machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, feature extraction, and optimization. For this reason Scikit-Learn is often the first tool in a Data Scientists toolkit for machine learning of incoming data sets. \n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this notebook is to serve as an introduction to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn. We will explore several clustering, classification, and regression algorithms. In particular, we will structure our machine learning models as though we were producing a data product, an actionable model that can be used in larger programs or algorithms; rather than as simply a research or investigation methodology.
